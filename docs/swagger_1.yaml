        Creates an account in the system. Accounts can be of type `CONSUMER`, `BUSINESS` or `STAKEHOLDER`.

        This service will automatically trigger the KYC/KYB and Identity Management process relevant to the account type.  

        Please note that an account cannot be duplicated within the same parent program account; an account is considered duplicated when the same `external_id` is provided.

        **Note**: For consumer accounts, if you do not set the `primary_address` property, you have to add an address separately to initiate the KYC process.

        How this service works:
          - Only the properties that are present on the request body will be updated.
          - Properties not present on the request body will remain unchanged in the system.
          - To update a property to an empty string or `null` you need to put the correct value on the request.

    post:
      summary: Load funds
      description: |
        Loads funds to a wallet.

        In order to load funds into the wallet, the user account needs to have a valid payment method, tokenized in the system through the payment methods services.
        Note that loading funds from a Bank Account requires that a Plaid token is present and valid in the system.

        Once funds are loaded in the user account, the account wallet will have the corresponding amount in the `transit` bucket. This means that the loading of funds transaction has been accepted, but the funds are not settled yet. Funds will be settled according to the selected payment method settlement times.

      summary: Withdraw funds
      description: |
        Alviere supports withdrawing funds from the user account's wallet to an external funding destination using this service.

        In order to withdraw funds from the account wallet, the user account needs to have a valid payment method, tokenized in the system through the payment methods services.
        Note that withdrawing funds to a Card requires that the push-to-debit service is active and the card supports this feature over the debit card rails of the network schemes.

        Once funds are withdrawn from the user account, the account wallet will have the corresponding amount in the `captive` bucket. This means that the withdrawing of funds transaction has been accepted, but the funds are not available in the destination source yet. Funds will be settled according to the selected payment method settlement times.

        **Important Note**: Although withdrawing of funds returns structure of the underlying payment transaction, account wallet operations can only be cancelled using the unique `transaction_uuid`.

        Use this endpoint to create a `CHECK_DEPOSIT` transaction for this wallet.

        The capture method for the front and back image of the check should always be done using Alviere's iOS or Android Mobile SDKs.

        Checks deposited in the accounts will remain as `captive` balance in the user account until they settle, however, you can decide to release all or part of the check amount prior to settlement.

                        Use this service fee value type if you want a service fee percentage to be applied on the total amount of the release. For example, if the total amount is $100 and you want to apply a 10% fee, you should set the property to `value: 10`

                        Set the `cap` field if you want the percentage amount to be capped to a certain amount. For example, if the total amount is $1000 and you want to apply a 10% fee capped to $50, you should set the `value: 10` and `cap: 5000`
